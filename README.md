Automatic Clock with ESP32 and NTP

This project demonstrates how to build a clock that automatically synchronizes its time with an NTP (Network Time Protocol) server, using an ESP32 microcontroller.

Key Features:

Retrieves accurate time from an NTP server
Displays the current time on a user-defined output device is MAX7219 LED Matrix
Potential for customization and expansion

Required Components:
ESP32 development board
WiFi connection
Jumper wires
Output device MAX7219 LED Matrix

Software Requirements:
Arduino IDE with ESP32 board support
NTPClient library (installable through the Arduino IDE Library Manager)
